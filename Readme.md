CommstatXW is a Python version of the CommStat software designed to run on Windows 10 operating systems. 
Windows 10 required Python to be installed (best installed as administrator) 
Here is the link https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.10.0/python-3.10.0-amd64.exe

Probably best to update python a bit before starting: <br>
<b>in a command prompt terminal type : python -m pip install --upgrade pip </b>
when the above command completes, make sure you are in the commstatx folder and then : <br>

Download the zip file to wherever you want it and unzip it and it will create the folder "commstatx", go into that folder and using command prompt terminal run install.py: 
<b>type: python install.py </b><br>
After a successful install (this installs all of the necessary Python modules) in a command prompt terminal : 
<b>type: python commstatx.py</b>    

you should see a settings window that must be populated with a callsign, and a path to the 
JS8Call log directory (use JS8Call "LOG" menu item and "Open Log Directory" to get the path and
make sure there is in fact a DIRECTED.TXT file there, the path should be something like : 
c:\users\yourname\appdata\local\js8call <b>do not enter the trailing slash or the file name.</b> 

After that is complete you should be able to run CommStatx by retyping in the command prompt terminal:<br>
<b> type : python commstatx.py </b>
<br>
